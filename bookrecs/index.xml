      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably my go-to recommendation to friends. Backman carves out every character so brilliantly that you end up connecting with each one, even in their worst times. Set in a declining small hockey town in the middle of nowhere, we experience a community stumbling through hard times and yet see depictions of genuine connection. Backman has a brand of magical realism where every character feels real and everything feels like it will work out in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
